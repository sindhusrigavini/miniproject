    <center><p><h4>Charminar is one of Hyderabad's most iconic landmarks, built in 1591 by Muhammad Quli Qutb Shah. The name "Charminar" translates to "Four Minarets," referring to its four grand towers adorned with intricate Indo-Islamic architecture.
This historic structure is located in the Old City of Hyderabad, near the bustling Laad Bazaar and the Makkah Masjid. It has served as a mosque for over 425 years and is a major site for festival celebrations, especially during Eid.
There are multiple theories about why Charminar was built. Some believe it was constructed to commemorate the eradication of the plague, while others suggest it marked the beginning of the second Islamic millennium
