    <center><p><h4>Varanasi, also known as Banaras or Kashi, is one of the oldest continuously inhabited cities in the world and a major spiritual hub in India. Located on the banks of the sacred Ganges River in Uttar Pradesh, it holds deep religious significance for Hindus, Buddhists, and Jains.
The city is famous for its ghats, where pilgrims perform rituals and take holy dips in the Ganges. The Ganga Aarti at Dashashwamedh Ghat is a mesmerizing spectacle that draws visitors from around the world. Varanasi is also home to the Kashi Vishwanath Temple, dedicated to Lord Shiva, and the nearby Sarnath, where Buddha gave his first sermon.
Beyond its spiritual essence, Varanasi is known for its vibrant culture, classical music, silk weaving, and bustling markets. The narrow alleys are filled with temples, street food stalls, and shops selling Banarasi silk sarees
